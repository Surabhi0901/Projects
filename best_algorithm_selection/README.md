# Generalized ML Model for Best Algorithm Selection

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to select the best algorithm for a given dataset. The script provides functionality to perform various tasks such as data upload, automated exploratory data analysis (EDA), missing value analysis, outlier handling, target selection, and algorithm selection.

## How to Run

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
3. Execute the script by running:
Replace `your_script.py` with the path to your Python script containing the provided code.

## Dependencies

The script requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- matplotlib
- ydata_profiling
- dtale
- streamlit
- streamlit_option_menu
- xgboost

Install these dependencies using `pip` before running the script.

## Usage

1. **Data Upload**: Upload a dataset in any format. The script supports various file formats and automatically detects the appropriate reader function.

2. **Automated EDA**: Conduct automated exploratory data analysis on the uploaded dataset using D-Tale.

3. **Missing Value Analysis**: Analyze missing values in the dataset and handle them by imputing mean values.

4. **Object to Numeric Conversion**: Convert categorical columns to numerical format as required for modeling.

5. **Boxplot Analysis**: Visualize outliers in the dataset using box plots.

6. **Outlier Handling**: Remove outliers from the dataset based on the interquartile range (IQR) method.

7. **Target Selection**: Select the target column for prediction.

8. **Main Algorithm Selection**: Automatically select the best algorithm based on the data type of the target column (regression or classification). The script evaluates various regression and classification algorithms and selects the one with the highest accuracy or R-squared score.

## Note

- Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted and labeled before uploading.
- Review the results carefully to understand the insights provided by each analysis step.
- The script provides a generalized approach to model selection and may require adjustments based on specific use cases or datasets.
